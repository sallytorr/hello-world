# hello-world

Hey there!

I am a Visual Communication Design graduate from 
Stellenbosch University who believes that design
should contribute to the betterment of society, as it
is our responsibility as designers to bring about change
in the world. My innovative and pragmatic approach
to design enables me to be a positive and enthusiastic
team-player who is motivated to make a difference.

I'm sorry that was my profile from my CV but my brain is fried and I can't think of anything to write!
